# game-of-craps
Simulation of a game of craps. 


Rules: The player rolls two dice. The sum of the two faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins.
        If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first throw (which is "craps"); the player loses. If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, 
        then that sum becomes the player's 'point'. To win, you continue rolling the dice until you 'make your point'. 
        The player loses by rolling a 7 before making point.
